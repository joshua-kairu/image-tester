# image-tester

Android images 101.

## Introduction :point_up:

This repo contains the implementation of a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) sample app that shows the various ways one can scale an image to fit inside an Android [ImageView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html). The tutorial was made to teach good image habits in Udacity's [Material Design for Android Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862) class. The class can be found online. Original code is stored in [this](https://github.com/udacity/ud862-samples) repository in the [Immersive Images folder](https://github.com/udacity/ud862-samples/tree/master/ImmersiveImages).

## Version History :package:

**latest** 	[XML Test v1.0.0](https://github.com/joshua-kairu/xml-test/releases/download/v1.0/XML-Test-v1.0.0.apk) 	Monday, June 6, 2016

This repo tries its best to follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines.

## How To Use :wrench:

:zero: Install and run the app.

:one: You'll find an Image by Julia Caesar with some radio buttons below it. Each radio button represents one of the ways to show an image inside an Android ImageView.

:two: Tap any radio button to see how the button's option affects the image.

A video? Yes. :smile:

## Abilities :muscle:

This app can:
* Show the most common image scaling options in Android.

## Limitations :worried:

This app is just a sample app. It does not:
* Have an option to change the image displayed.

## Possible Future Work :fast_forward:

As of Monday, June 6, 2016, some future app work here could be: 
- [ ] Allow users to change the picture in the app. 
- [ ] Use a [Palette](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette.html) to color the items in the radio buttons.
- [ ] Have a small section of the screen display an animation of the words of the selected scaling options.

## Other things :books:

* Udacity for this app's building blocks.
* Jake Wharton for [Butter Knife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/), a library for binding fields to views in Android.
